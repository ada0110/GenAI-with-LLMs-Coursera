This repository contains my notes for the ["Generative AI with LLMs"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) course on Coursera, offered by DeepLearning.AI

This course provides foundational understanding of:

- What are LLMs, go into the details of transformers
- LLMs Pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference 
- Prompting and prompt engineering
- RLHF - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback 
- Applications of LLMs for text generation, summarization, Q&A
- Evaluation methods for generative models
- GenAI Project lifecyle
- Safety, bias, and limitations of LLMs
